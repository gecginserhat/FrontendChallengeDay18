Day 18: To-Do List Project & ES6+ Features<br/>

📝 Day 18 of my 21-day coding challenge, and today I worked on a full-featured To-Do List project while diving into ES6+ features! Here's what I learned:<br/>

📋 To-Do Project:<br/>

Created an interface for adding, displaying, and managing todos.<br/>
Stored todos in local storage and ensured they load on page refresh.<br/>
Added features for deleting and filtering todos, and even clearing them all with a single click.<br/>
🚀 ES6+ Features:<br/>

Arrow functions for cleaner, concise syntax.<br/>
Destructuring for unpacking arrays and objects.<br/>
Spread Operator for combining arrays/objects.<br/>
Mastered for-in and for-of loops, Maps, and Sets for advanced data handling.<br/>
Feeling confident with ES6+ now! 💪<br/>
